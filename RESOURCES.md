## Tips for Learning Java after Python
- Focus on understanding Java's strict typing system compared to Python's dynamic typing.
- Get comfortable with compiling code. Unlike Python, Java requires compilation before running.
- Java enforces Object-Oriented principles more strictly than Python, so pay attention to class structure and inheritance.

These resources should provide a comprehensive foundation as you begin your Java class. Good luck and happy coding!
